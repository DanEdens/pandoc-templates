# Pandoc Templates

An opinionated set of Pandoc templates and scripts for generating .docx manuscripts that adhere to [William Shunn's Proper Manuscript Format](https://www.shunn.net/format/) guidelines using [pandoc](https://www.shunn.net/format/).

## Getting Started

These templates and scripts aim to be easy to install and use, and consistent across Windows, Mac, and Linux. I generally use Mac and Linux at home, so Windows scripts may lag behind those.

### Prerequisites

Everything is built around [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Full

## Usage

[Shunn's Short Story](https://www.shunn.net/format/story.html) format is a generally acceptable format for submitting short stories to markets.
